# Connect Four - Group Project

## Project overview

This project is a collaborative effort by our agile team to create a Four in a Row (Connect Four) game using Vite, TypeScript, and React. The application allows players to compete in a classic grid-based game where the objective is to connect four discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Game key

- Game Modes: Players can choose from several game modes:
  - Two human players
  - Human vs. Computer (with multiple AI difficulty levels)
  - Computer vs. Computer (AI vs. AI)
- AI Difficulty: The game includes both a simple AI and a more advanced AI for challenging gameplay.
- Player Selection: Users can set player names, choose the type of player, and decide who will start the game.
- New Game Options: After each game, players can start a new game while retaining or resetting their previous settings.
- Responsive Design: The game adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile, ensuring a smooth user experience on all devices.
